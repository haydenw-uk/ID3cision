# Decision Tree Classifier

This repository showcases my implementation of a Decision Tree classifier, developed for my first-year university coursework project. The classifier is built using the **ID3 algorithm (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)**, a fundamental supervised machine learning approach for classification.

## Key Features

- **Entropy and Information Gain**  
  Calculates entropy and selects the optimal attribute for splitting based on maximum information gain.

- **ID3 Algorithm Implementation**  
  Recursively builds the decision tree, handling pure subsets, majority class selection, and child node creation.

- **Custom Tree Structure**  
  Uses a `Node` class to represent decision tree nodes, supporting attributes, values, and children.

- **Dataset Handling**  
  Processes categorical datasets in CSV format for both training and testing.

- **Prediction and Evaluation**  
  Implements a prediction function to classify new instances and measure model accuracy on test data.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates the practical application of theoretical machine learning concepts, including entropy and information theory. It highlights skills in Python programming, data manipulation, and building custom models from scratch.
